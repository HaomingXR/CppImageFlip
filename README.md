# C++ Image Flip
- This is a simple C++ library that allows you to flip a Texture vertically
  > This is originally developed for use in Unity, as the coordinate system between Unity and Nvidia is different.
- See `FlipDemo.cs` and `ImageFlip.cs` for how to use this.
- **Note:** Only `RGB24` and `RGBA32` images are supported.
